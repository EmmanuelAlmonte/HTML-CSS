    9. Practice Validating CSS. Choose a CSS external style sheet file to validate; perhaps
you have created one for your own website. Otherwise, use an external style sheet file
that you worked with in this chapter. Use the W3C CSS validator at http://jigsaw.w3.org/
css-validator. If your CSS does not immediately pass the validation test, modify it and
test again. Repeat this process until the W3C validates your CSS code. Write a one- or
two-paragraph summary about the validation process that answers the following ques-
tions: Was the CSS validator easy to use? Did anything surprise you? Did you encounter
a number of errors or just a few? How easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS
file? Would you recommend the validator to other students? Why or why not?-->
